# Weekend SQL TO Do List


## Description
Duration Weekend project (20+ hours of work)

My app takes in tasks and allows users to make a list of "to-do" items. It has a text box and a submit button which takes in a "to-do" item. Once an item is added a table, the description/item is created along with 2 clickable buttons. One of the buttons will mark the project as complete and the other will delete the entry. The entires are stored in a database and will save data even after the app is exited.
